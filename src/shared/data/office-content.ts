        intro: "The Office is the production environment of my professional brand. Unlike 'The Lab', which explores potentiality, 'The Office' deals in reality: P&L mastery, risk mitigation, and the concrete execution of complex systems. It is designed to demonstrate Tri-Modal Leadership in action.",

        "In the modern enterprise, value is destroyed in the gap between Strategy and Execution. The Office is designed to close that gap.",
        "It serves as a <strong>Semantic Twin</strong> of my own leadership philosophy: that an effective leader must be able to translate between the Boardroom (Executive), the Whiteboard (Strategist), and the Terminal (Engineer).",
        "This view provides a frictionless interface for Private Equity partners, C-Suite peers, and Technical Recruiters to audit my capabilities without the noise of creative exploration."

        boardroom: "Boardroom: Focuses on Outcome, Risk, and ROI. The interface is clean, data-dense, and devoid of distraction.",
