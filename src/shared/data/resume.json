This innovation enabled \"Read-Only\" operational oversight without violating strict data privacy laws, ensuring full compliance with EU DORA and GDPR resilience mandates while maintaining high-touch service.</p></li><li><p>Directed operational product strategy for the critical FXall-to-Workspace SaaS migration, defining user stories for platform logging and tooling.
