# Lab View Widget

## Description
The **Lab View** represents the "Technical Execution" mode. It provides a raw, code-centric, or "workbench" view of projects and experiments.

## Semantic Twin
- **Public Guide:** `src/app/guide/lab`
- **URL:** `/guide/lab`
- **Manifesto:** The "Lab" semantic twin also serves as the project's experimentation manifesto.

## Governance
Technical experiments added here should be documented in the Semantic Twin to ensure AI agents understand the "Engineer" persona.
